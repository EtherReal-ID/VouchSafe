A zeroKnoledge Proof Information validation service for etherReal People.

##Data is mined by third parties and bad actors.
In web 2.0 whenever one interacts with a third party service like github, facebook or your favourite online shop, you have to expose your information to their servers.  It may be just your I.P. , email address or your age, your address or your gender but each piece of information can be aggregated like puzzle pieces to build up a profile of you and your online activity, which then leads to a profile of your off line identity.  Sometimes you want the third party to know who you are; but do you want ANYONE, with either the financial resources or technical capability to obtain your entire profile from data brokers, server silos, or off the wires?




What if you could put your identifying information, (contact information, medical records, credit history, age, gender, sexual preferences, political sympathies, etc.â€¦...) into a form of validated storage that you control?  This would let you expose any single piece ,or multiple set, of information you might like to reveal in a format that, not only could you be guaranteed that only they could access but also that would allow you to offer them proof that it the information was true within which ever range of truth you set?  e.g.  to choose to offer your age in a format like (20) (15-30) (under 30) (old enough to vote) 

This is the vision of *VouchSafe* 

By requiring multi-signature access to your information and offering third parties zero knowledge proof that the information is valid you gain digital data sovereignty.  How much and how tittle information you share becomes a choice once more which you can choose to use only the services that are prepared to let you manage your data as you desire.
