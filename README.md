In web 2.0 whenever one interacts with a third party service like github, facebook or your favourite online shop, you have to expose your information to their servers.  It may be just your I.P. , email address or your age, your address or your gender but each piece of information can be aggregated like puzzle pieces to build up a profile of you and your online activity, which then leads to a profile of your off line identity.  Sometimes you want the third party to know who you are; but do you want ANYONE, with either the financial resources or technical capability to obtain your entire profile from data brokers, server silos, or off the wires?

What if you could put yuro identifying information, (medical records, credit history, age, gender, sexual preferences, political sympathies, contact information etc.â€¦...) into a form of storage that you control?  This would let you expose any information you might like to reveal to one or other organisation in a format that, not only could you be guaranteed that only they could see but also that would allow you to keep a log of when it was used?

This is the vision of VouchSafe
